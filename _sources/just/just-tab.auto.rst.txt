Tab completion
==============

.. file:: .just

*Tab* completion suggestions based on parsing the :file:`Justfile` case statements can easily be added to your bash session by sourcing the :file:`.just` file. This file is sourced for you when you source the :ref:`setup file <just-setup-file>`

The *tab* completion script can be extended by adding a ``.just`` file to your project next to the :file:`Justfile`. Write what would normally go inside the ``complete`` function to the ``.just`` file (without the bash ``function()`` header). This file will be sourced by :file:`.just` after the ``just_commands`` and ``_just_subcommands`` arrays are populated. See :ref:`here <just_autocomplete>` for an example:

The ``.just`` can optionally set a ``JUST_RETURN`` variable that will be stop the execution of the rest of :file:`.just` and return the vaule of ``JUST_RETURN``. This is useful when you do not want the rest of the default behavior in a particular case.
