Tab completion

.. file:: .just

*Tab* completion suggestions based on parsing the :file:`Justfile`'s case statements can easily be added to your bash session by sourcing the :file:`.just` file. Note: this file is sourced for you when you source the :ref:`setup file <just-setup-file>`

The *tab* completion script can be extended by adding a ``.just`` file to your project next to the :file:`Justfile`. Put what would normally go inside the ``complete -F`` function in the ``.just`` file (but without the bash ``function()`` header). This file will be sourced by :file:`.just` after the ``just_commands`` and ``_just_subcommands`` arrays are populated. See `just`'s default implementation :ref:`here <just_autocomplete>` for an example.

The project's ``.just`` file can optionally set a ``JUST_RETURN`` variable that will stop the execution of the rest of :file:`.just` and return the value of ``JUST_RETURN``. This is useful when you do not want the rest of the default behavior in a particular case.
