def sub_block(data, block=3, overlap=0, subok=False):
  ''' Return an array of windows into the original data array.

      Parameters
      ----------
      data : array_like
          N-dimensional array
      block : int
          The block size of the final blocks. Should have length N or be a
          single number
      overlap : float
          The amount of overlap between windows. A value of 0 has no overlap,
          while positive values overlap by that much, and negative values have
          gaps of that size.
      subok : bool
          Passed to as_strided

      Returns
      -------
      array_like
          windows - N + N dimensional array where the first N dimensions are
          the window indexes, and the next N dimension are the data dimensions.
          Keep in mind, all the data is linked to the original data array.
          Changing values in one place changes them all.

      list
          remainders - An N length list of the number of elements not included
          in the windows: the remainder of the sub-blocks. Another function
          could use these values to sub_block over them too. In the 2D case,
          there would be 3 groups of windows, in 3D case 6 groups of windows,
          etc...


      Example::

            >> qq = np.arange(25).reshape(5,5)
            >> q,r = sub_block(qq, block=3, overlap=(2,1))
            >> q

            array([[[[ 0,  1,  2],
                    [ 5,  6,  7],
                    [10, 11, 12]],

                    [[ 2,  3,  4],
                    [ 7,  8,  9],
                    [12, 13, 14]]],


                    [[[ 5,  6,  7],
                    [10, 11, 12],
                    [15, 16, 17]],

                    [[ 7,  8,  9],
                    [12, 13, 14],
                    [17, 18, 19]]],


                    [[[10, 11, 12],
                    [15, 16, 17],
                    [20, 21, 22]],

                    [[12, 13, 14],
                    [17, 18, 19],
                    [22, 23, 24]]]])
